3.210       error: Multiple top-level packages discovered in a flat-layout: ['shared', 'user_service'].
3.210
3.210       To avoid accidental inclusion of unwanted files or directories,
3.210       setuptools will not proceed with this build.
3.210
3.210       If you are trying to create a single distribution with multiple packages
3.210       on purpose, you should not rely on automatic discovery.
3.210       Instead, consider the following options:
3.210
3.210       1. set up custom discovery (`find` directive with `include` or `exclude`)
3.210       2. use a `src-layout`
3.210       3. explicitly set `py_modules` or `packages` with a list of names
3.210
3.210       To find more information, look for "package discovery" on setuptools docs.
