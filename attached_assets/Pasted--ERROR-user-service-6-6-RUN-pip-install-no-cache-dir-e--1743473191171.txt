2.424       error: Multiple top-level packages discovered in a flat-layout: ['shared', 'user_service'].
2.424
2.424       To avoid accidental inclusion of unwanted files or directories,
2.424       setuptools will not proceed with this build.
2.424
2.424       If you are trying to create a single distribution with multiple packages
2.424       on purpose, you should not rely on automatic discovery.
2.424       Instead, consider the following options:
2.424
2.424       1. set up custom discovery (`find` directive with `include` or `exclude`)
2.424       2. use a `src-layout`
2.424       3. explicitly set `py_modules` or `packages` with a list of names
2.424
2.424       To find more information, look for "package discovery" on setuptools docs.
